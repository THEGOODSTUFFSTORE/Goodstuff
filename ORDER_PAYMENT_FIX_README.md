# Order and Payment System Fix

## Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Orders Not Reflecting on Customer Accounts
**Problem**: When customers placed orders as guests and later logged in or created accounts, their previous orders would not appear in their dashboard.

**Root Cause**: Guest orders were assigned `userId: 'guest'`, but when users logged in, the dashboard only searched for orders with their actual user ID.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Automatic Guest Order Linking**: When users sign up or log in, the system now automatically links any guest orders made with their email address to their account.
2. **Enhanced Order Fetching**: Updated the dashboard to fetch both user orders and any remaining guest orders with matching email.
3. **Server-Side Functions**: Added `linkGuestOrdersToUser()` and `getOrdersByUserServer()` functions for robust order management.

### Issue 2: Payment Status Remains Pending in Admin Dashboard
**Problem**: Even after successful payments via Pesapal, the admin dashboard continued to show payment status as "pending".

**Root Cause**: While the payment callback and IPN handlers were correctly implemented, there were potential issues with error handling, race conditions, and lack of debugging tools.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Payment Debug Tools**: Added comprehensive admin tools to debug and fix payment status issues.
2. **Force Sync Capability**: Admins can now force synchronize payment status with Pesapal.
3. **Manual Override Options**: Added ability to manually mark payments as paid when necessary.
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better logging and error reporting for payment processing.

## New Features Added

### 1. Automatic Guest Order Linking
- Triggers when users create sessions (login/signup)
- Links orders by matching email addresses
- Non-blocking process (won't fail session creation)

### 2. Admin Payment Debug Tools
- **Debug Information**: View detailed order and payment status information
- **Force Sync**: Synchronize payment status with Pesapal using stored tracking IDs
- **Manual Payment Marking**: Mark orders as paid manually when needed
- **Reset to Pending**: Reset payment status for troubleshooting
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better visibility into payment processing

### 3. Improved Order Fetching
- Handles both authenticated user orders and guest orders
- Prevents duplicate orders in customer dashboards
- Better error handling and logging

### 4. Enhanced Debug Endpoints
- `/api/debug-order`: Comprehensive order debugging with analysis
- `/api/admin/fix-payment`: Payment status fixing tools
- `/api/customers/[id]`: Get customer orders with linking capabilities

## Files Modified

### Core System Files
- `lib/server/firebaseAdmin.ts` - Added guest order linking functions
- `app/api/auth/session/route.ts` - Auto-link guest orders on login
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Improved order fetching logic

### Admin Tools
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Added payment debug modal and tools
- `app/api/admin/fix-payment/route.ts` - Enhanced payment fixing capabilities
- `app/api/customers/[id]/route.ts` - Customer order management
- `app/api/debug-order/route.ts` - Enhanced debugging tools

## How to Use the New Features

### For Customers
1. **Existing Users**: Orders will automatically link when they log in
2. **New Users**: Guest orders will be linked when they create accounts with the same email
3. **Order History**: All orders (guest and authenticated) now appear in the dashboard

### For Admins
1. **Payment Issues**: Click the ðŸ”§ icon next to any order to open the payment debug modal
2. **Debug Info**: Click "Get Debug Info" to see detailed payment status information
3. **Force Sync**: Use "Force Sync with Pesapal" to update payment status from Pesapal
4. **Manual Override**: Use "Mark as Paid" for confirmed payments that aren't syncing
5. **Reset**: Use "Reset to Pending" to restart payment processing if needed

## Testing the Solution

### Test Case 1: Guest Order Linking
1. Place an order as a guest with email `test@example.com`
2. Create an account or log in with the same email
3. Verify the guest order appears in the dashboard

### Test Case 2: Payment Status Sync
1. Find an order with pending payment status in admin
2. Click the ðŸ”§ debug tool
3. Use "Force Sync" to update from Pesapal
4. Verify payment status updates correctly

### Test Case 3: Manual Payment Fixing
1. For a confirmed paid order showing as pending
2. Use the "Mark as Paid" option in the debug modal
3. Verify order status updates to "processing"

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Logs to Monitor
```bash
# Check for guest order linking
console.log('Linked X guest orders to user Y')

# Payment callback processing
console.log('=== PESAPAL CALLBACK START ===')
console.log('Payment status from Pesapal:', paymentStatus)

# Order updates
console.log('Order updated successfully')
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Orders Still Not Showing**
   - Check if email addresses match exactly
   - Use `/api/debug-order?userEmail=email@example.com` to investigate
   - Manually link using admin tools

2. **Payment Status Not Updating**
   - Verify Pesapal IPN is configured correctly
   - Check callback URL is accessible
   - Use admin debug tools to force sync

3. **Callback/IPN Issues**
   - Ensure `PESAPAL_IPN_ID` environment variable is set
   - Re-register IPN URL if needed: `POST /api/payments/pesapal/register-ipn`
   - Check network connectivity to Pesapal

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Existing variables
PESAPAL_CONSUMER_KEY=your_key
PESAPAL_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_secret
PESAPAL_API_URL=https://pay.pesapal.com/v3
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=your_app_url

# Required for IPN
PESAPAL_IPN_ID=your_ipn_id
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: No database schema changes required
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `PESAPAL_IPN_ID` is configured
3. **Testing**: Test guest order linking and payment debug tools in staging
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for successful guest order linking

## API Endpoints Added/Modified

- `POST /api/customers/[id]` - Link guest orders for specific customer
- `POST /api/admin/fix-payment` - Payment debugging and fixing tools
- `GET /api/debug-order` - Enhanced order debugging with analysis
- `POST /api/auth/session` - Now includes automatic guest order linking

## Security Considerations

- All admin tools require proper authentication
- Guest order linking only works with verified email addresses
- Payment modifications are logged with admin user details
- Debug information is only available to authenticated admins

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Payment Reconciliation**: Periodic sync with Pesapal for all pending orders
2. **Email Notifications**: Notify customers when guest orders are linked
3. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging for all payment status changes
4. **Dashboard Widgets**: Real-time payment status monitoring for admins
